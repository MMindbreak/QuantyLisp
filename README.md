# Quanty LISP
##### A simple LISP written in python aimed at quantitative researchers

This is a first implementation (alpha but not the one you like) of a simple LISP including
an editor to allow for quick and interactive research of quantitative trading strategies.

## TODO
### LISP
* implement basic LISP functionality like (define, set!)
* add support for CSV, matplotlib, pandas
* add support to directly call python functions (maybe...)
### Editor
* add auto formatting
* syntax checking
* autocomplete with dropdown
